under *Site Administration* -&gt; *Translations*. The items are *Labels*
and *Menu Items*, as shown below.

*Menu Items* tab enables translation of the various menus (described in
[Section 4](4_1.md) of this manual).

For *Labels*, clicking on the *Edit* button allows you to edit the items
in their language of choice.
