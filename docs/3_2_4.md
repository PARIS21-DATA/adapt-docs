## 3.2.4.1 Adding organisations

To add organisations in the ADAPT instance, under the *Lists* section in
*Site Administration*, click on *Organisations*. The resulting page
displays a list, above which the option to *Add Organisation* is
available. Note that the list of organisations can be downloaded
directly in Excel or CSV formats.

><a id="figure22" class="figure-title">Figure 22: Setting up organisations in ADAPT</a>
><img src="ADAPTmedia\media\image21.png" class="figures" />

Upon clicking on *Add Organisation*, the form to add an organisation
appears. It contains the following fields:

1.  Organisation Name

2.  Organisation Abbreviation

3.  Organisation website URL: Exists or not? *Yes* or *No* (if *Yes*,
    the option to add the URL appears)

4.  Govt. Statistical Office? *Yes* or *No*

5.  Geographic coverage

6.  Organisation Type

Fill in all fields and save the information by clicking on Save. This
would result in a Completeness score (top right-hand corner of the form)
of 100%.

PARIS21 maintains an ADAPT central repository that also contains
prestored information on certain global organisations (the World Bank,
the World Health Organization, etc.), to facilitate direct use for your
specific instance. However, to view these organisations in the list, you
must first access the *Library* section of *Site Administration* (see
Section 3.2.4). Once you have selected the organisation in the library,
you may view it in the list of organisations in your specific instance.

**Note on geographic coverage:** For an organisation,
the geographic area over which its authority extends flows from the
highest through the lowest level. Therefore, when a “parent” node is
selected in the form above, all “child” nodes under that parent node
should also be selected. For example, if an organisation applies to a
country in terms of geographic coverage, it also applies to the
provinces within the country. (***See Box 6 – Entering geographic
coverage)***

## 3.2.4.2 Adding departments

ADAPT facilitates coordination not only among different planning
agencies or organisations, but also within different departments of the
same agency or organisation. To add departments within the organisations
previously entered, under the *Lists* section of *Site Administration*,
click on *Departments*. The resulting page displays a list, above which
the option to *Add* departments is available. Note that the list of
departments can be downloaded directly in Excel or CSV formats.

><a id="figure24" class="figure-title">Figure 24: Setting up <i>Departments</i> in ADAPT</a>

You may click on the *Edit* option at the top right-hand corner to
modify or translate the names of the items previously entered in the
list of measurement units. Clicking on *Save* stores all changes made.

As noted above, PARIS21 maintains an ADAPT central repository that also
contains prestored information on many standardised units of
measurement, to facilitate direct use for your specific instance. These
are marked in the list with a coloured background and cannot be edited
by users.

contains prestored information on many standardised disaggregation
variables (age, sex, location, etc.), to facilitate direct use for your
specific instance. These are marked in the list with a coloured
background and cannot be edited by users.

## 3.2.4.5 Defining and adding indicator priorities 

The various indicators required in policies (or logframes) may have
differing degrees of importance or priority. Up to three levels of
priorities are already provided in ADAPT. To add descriptions to these
priorities or to add more priorities, under the *Lists* section of *Site
Administration*, click on *Indicator / priorities*. The resulting page
displays a list, above which options to *Add* or *Translate* are
available. Note that these can be downloaded directly in Excel or CSV
formats.

><a id="figure32" class="figure-title">Figure 32: Indicator priorities in ADAPT</a>
><img src="ADAPTmedia\media\image31.png" class="figures" />

To add more priorities, under the *Lists* section of *Site
Administration*, click on *Add*. The resulting page displays the
following self-explanatory fields: Name and Description. Fill in all
fields and save the information by clicking on *Save*.

## 3.2.4.6 Defining and adding indicator collections

In the context of ADAPT, the term “collection” refers to a group of
indicators with shared element(s), as uniquely predefined by an
administrator under the *Site Administration* page. For instance, a
collection may be defined as "Rural development" and group together
indicators relating to health, security, agriculture and other sectors
relevant to rural development. Collections are a way for ADAPT users to
bring together indicators in a cross-cutting manner, beyond traditional
groupings such as geographic levels or sectoral coverage.

Three collections are already provided in ADAPT. To add descriptions to
these collections or to add more collections, under the *Lists* section
of *Site Administration*, click on *Indicator / collection*. The
resulting page displays a list above which the options to *Add* or
*Translate* are available. Note that these can be downloaded directly in
Excel or CSV formats.

><a id="figure35" class="figure-title">Figure 35: Indicator collections in ADAPT</a>
><img src="ADAPTmedia\media\image34.png" class="figures" />

To add definitions of collections, under the *Lists* section of *Site
Administration*, click on *Add*. The resulting page displays the
following self-explanatory fields: Name and Description. Fill in all
fields and save the information by clicking on *Save*.

><a id="figure36" class="figure-title">Figure 36: Adding an indicator collection</a>

may click on the *Edit* option in the top right-hand corner and modify
or translate the items previously entered in the list of *Indicator /
collections*. Clicking on *Save* stores all changes made.
