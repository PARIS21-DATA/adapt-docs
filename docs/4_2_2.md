## 4.2.2 Logframes <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

A logframe, which is an abbreviation for logical framework, is an
integral aspect of a robust policy document. Effective development
planning usually includes a mechanism for the M&E of the outcomes of
policy interventions in the short and the long term, and this is
captured by a results chain framework. [See Section 5 (Annex
5.2)](5_2_1.md) for a detailed explanation
of the concept.

ADAPT’s logframe section, which is based on the terminology proposed by
the OECD Development Assistance Committee (DAC),[[5]](5_2_1.md) plays a crucial role
in enabling the standardisation of the underlying results chain
framework of various policy documents, each of which may follow a
different semantic structure. It helps to develop logframe structures
that are coherent and compatible across sectors and administrative
divisions.

Figure 48 below shows the first screen that appears upon clicking on the
*Logframes* menu, indicating that four logframes have been entered into
the system – similar to the first *Policies* screen depicted in Figure 1.
As before, the left side of the screen displays the options for
performing a *Search* of a logframe by title or to *Filter* according to
different criteria: sector, date, policy and geographic coverage.
Clicking on the arrowheads (to the left of each criterion’s fields)
extends the tree in the expanded grey portion, as before. Note that the
list of logframes is downloadable directly in CSV or Excel format.

To add a new logframe in ADAPT, simply click on the <img src="ADAPTmedia\media\image60.png" />
button. A familiar screen pops up and the following set of horizontal
and vertical tabs appears. The numbers next to the red arrows indicate
the sequence in which you should fill in the information.

However, often, it is different (for example, the logframe may detail the “Goals” of a policy intervention – a category that is not available in ADAPT).</p><p>The highest level is usually a broad policy impact.

>
>Logframes can exist independently of a policy document. An example is
the Minimum Set of Gender Indicators prepared by the United Nations
Statistical Commission (UNSC) as a “guide for national production and
international compilation of gender statistics.” It is a collection of
52 quantitative and 11 qualitative indicators, classified across three
tiers.
>
>Although the Agenda 2030 mentions gender equality as the fifth goal
within the SDGs, which could serve as the “link” to a policy – it could
be argued that there is no specific policy document pertaining to this
particular set of indicators.
