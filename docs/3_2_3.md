### 3.2.3. Setting up the geography or area

To add a geographic structure in ADAPT, under the *Geography* option in
*Site Administration*, click on *Area levels*. Note the levels (or
nodes) that are already available in the tree: *Global*, *Regional*,
*National* and *Sub-national*. Of these, only the *Sub-national* node
can be edited. New nodes representing subnational-level entities below
this grouping can be added by right-clicking on the *Sub-national* node
and selecting *Create*. Nodes at lower levels can be added in a similar
way. Clicking on the *Save* button saves all changes.

***Note!*** In an ADAPT instance, the <u>exact names</u> of the
geographic entities should be entered in the tree. For example, instead
of writing “Province” or “State” for a subnational entity, write the
<u>name</u> of the province or state.

The depth of the hierarchy should depend on the lowest geographic level
for which data are (or will be) available. For example, if data is (or
is expected to be) available at a country’s third geographic level (in a
descending hierarchy, from country to state and to district), then the
names of entities up to that level (the third level, districts) should
be entered in ADAPT.
