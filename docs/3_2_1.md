### General settings: Customise

Under this section of ADAPT, the user may edit the look and feel of the
interface by modifying the description and adding customised logo for
their own interface. This can be done by accessing *Site Administration*
and then clicking on *Customise* -&gt; ***Description*** or *Customise*
-&gt; ***Logo** -&gt; Choose File.*

Also note that the local currency can be specified for a particular
instance under *Site Administration* -&gt; *Customise* -&gt; ***Local
currency**.* A drop down list of currency and their symbols appears.

Finally, this section under *Site Administration* -&gt; *Customise*
-&gt; ***inflation percent*** allows the user to enter the annual
inflation in percentages.
