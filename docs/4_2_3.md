### 4.2.3 Indicators

The *Indicators* menu item is where demand-side and supply-side elements
meet. It contains a repository of all indicators demanded by a policy or
logframe (or even indicators without links to either) and corresponding
information on their availability. Here, the role of the mapping
functionality is of prime importance in showcasing any overlaps and gaps
in planning: a fundamental functionality of ADAPT itself.

Figure 53 illustrates the first screen that appears upon clicking on the
*Indicators* menu, showing that 258 indicators have been entered into
the system. As before, the left side of the screen displays options to
*Search* for an indicator or *Filter* according to logframe or policy.
Clicking on the arrowheads to the left of each criterion’s fields
extends the tree in the expanded grey portion, as before. Note that the
list of Logframes may be downloaded directly in CSV or Excel formats.

To add a new indicator in ADAPT, simply click on the
<img src="ADAPTmedia\media\image73.png" style="width:1in;height:0.248in" />
option. The following screen appears (Figure 54); you must indicate
whether the indicator is linked to a policy, a logframe or neither.

<span id="_Toc7208969" class="anchor"></span>Box 10 – Did you know? Bulk
upload feature for indicators!

ADAPT allows for bulk uploading of indicators and related metadata via
Microsoft Excel. This feature is described in detail in [Section
5.4](#bulk-upload-feature-for-indicators) of this manual.

Now, as shown in Figure 54 above, choose one of the options listed next
to *Link with primary*. If a link exists, you must choose the
corresponding policy or logframe from the drop-down list, which contains
options of logframes or policies entered in the preceding menu items.

<span id="_Toc7208970" class="anchor"></span>Box 11 – Did you know?
Indicators with no links!

It is not necessary for indicators to be linked to a policy or logframe.
An example is the Global Strategy to improve Agricultural and Rural
Statistics (Global Strategy), prepared by the World Bank, UNSD and the
Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO). The
Global Strategy specifies a menu of indicators and a Minimum Set of Core
Data that are not linked to any global or national policies or
logframes.

Then, select the specific level and value to which the indicator is
attached (recall that the relevant indicator box in the logframe section
was checked when defining the nodes). An example is shown in Figure 55
below.

in the *Indicators* menu

<img src="ADAPTmedia\media\image75.png" style="width:5.96715in;height:2.58258in" />

Next, a familiar screen appears, with the following set of horizontal
and vertical tabs. If there is no linkage with a policy or logframe,
then the *No link* option in the above figure is selected and these
horizontal and vertical tabs appear immediately.

The numbers next to the red arrows indicate the sequence in which the
information should be entered.

<p>A proxy is conceptually akin to a “supply-side” mapping. Therefore, it is recommended that once a proxy indicator has been entered for the unavailable original indicator, the two indicators also be linked on the demand side. This means that the two processes must proceed together. Once a proxy indicator for an indicator has been identified, it must also be mapped under <em>Indicators</em> -&gt; <em>Mapping</em> -&gt; <em>Reflection between demands</em>.</p>

<p>Prevailing data sources pertain to how an indicator is compiled.</p>
<p>The prevailing data sources category for a given indicator is defined as the category which provides or is expected to provide in future: (i) all data needed for its compilation or (ii) data on the indicator’s numerator (as these data are specific to the indicator) while data on the indicators denominator are compiled from the data sources common to many indicators, e.g. country’s population or GDP. If neither of these two cases apply (e.g. the numerator requires use of different categories of data sources) the prevailing category is designated as mixed sources. The category of mixed data sources is used also in the cases when various data sources might be used but there is no sufficient information.</p>
<p><strong>Examples (in case of SDG indicators).</strong></p>
<p>Prevailing data sources for indicator “1.2.1 Proportion of population living below the national poverty line, by sex and age” are statistical (the population census and household surveys provide the required data) while prevailing data sources for indicator “1.a.2 Proportion of total government spending on essential services (education, health and social protection)” are administrative (records of the responsible governmental agencies are used to compile this indicator). Prevailing data sources for indicators “9.c.1 Proportion of population covered by a mobile network, by technology” and “11.5.2 Direct disaster economic loss in relation to global gross domestic product (GDP)” are administrative as data on the population covered by a mobile network, by technology, and on direct economic losses due to disasters are typically compiled from the administrative records of the relevant governmental agencies. Prevailing data sources for indicator “1.3.1 Proportion of population covered by social protection floors/systems, by sex, distinguishing children, unemployed persons, older persons, persons with disabilities, pregnant women, newborns, work-injury victims and the poor and the vulnerable” are designated as mixed since the evaluation of the indicator’s numerator might require use of both statistical and administrative data sources</p></td>
