### 5.2.2 A practical example 

Suppose that we wish to enter the *Vanuatu National Sustainable
Development Plan (2016-2030)* into ADAPT. We could proceed in the
following manner.

The plan describes an M&E framework structure with three pillars, each
having goals and objectives, with indicators attached to policy
objectives as shown in figure 72.

a results chain framework from Vanuatu’s NDP

Figure 73 indicates the six goals of the first pillar (*Society*). The
first goal is further expanded to display its first policy objective and
attached indicators and targets in figure 74, to provide a bird’s-eye
view of the plan’s M&E structure. All other pillars follow the same
structural logic.

To translate the results chain framework of Vanuatu’s plan (above) into
the ADAPT *Logframe*, which is slightly different, the corresponding
results chain nodes could be overlapped, as below:

Table 10: Operationalising the results chain framework in ADAPT –
example 1

<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>ADAPT levels</th>
<th><p>Vanuatu’s National Sustainable Development Plan</p>
<p><em>M&amp;E framework</em></p></th>
<th>Indicators linked? Y/N</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Inputs</td>
<td></td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Activities</td>
<td></td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Outputs</td>
<td>Policy Objectives</td>
<td>Yes</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Outcomes</td>
<td>Goals</td>
<td>No</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Impacts</td>
<td>Pillars</td>
<td>No</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Only three levels in Vanuatu’s NSDP correspond to the ADAPT levels, due
to the absence of inputs or activities. We may also note that the
Society, Environment and Economy pillars could also be interpreted as
“Improving Society, the Environment and the Economy”, as they
effectively indicate long-term *Impact* areas or sectors. Similarly, the
Goals could be reinterpreted consistently as *Outcomes* and Policy
Objectives as *Outputs*, for the purposes of entering them into ADAPT.
Figure 75 below shows how the information above is displayed in the
ADAPT window:

Similarly, for *Data Plans*, we take the case of Rwanda’s second
National Strategy for the Development of Statistics (2014/15-2018/19),
which describes the ”Implementation and budget plan”, a portion of which
is given in Figure 76:

National Strategy for the Development of Statistics

In ADAPT, one way to enter this information consistently is depicted
below.

Note that the *Plan Content* option under the *Description* tab of the
*Data Plans* menu has been selected, instead of the *Monitoring
Framework* option, as the Implementation and budget plan above does not
mention any indicators.

The NSDS M&E framework, if mentioned in the document, can be entered
into ADAPT using the same logic of mapping ADAPT levels of the results
chain framework onto the NSDS M&E levels.
