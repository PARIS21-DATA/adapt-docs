# 2. ADAPT sandbox: first-time user documentation <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

The ADAPT sandbox environment allows for the creation of individual
ADAPT instances for testing purposes. Sandbox instances function like
instances of the production environment and allow users to become
familiar with the ADAPT experience before they establish a proper ADAPT
session.
