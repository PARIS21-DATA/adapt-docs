## 1.2 Challenges in data planning <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

Every statistical office experiences challenges in its data planning
activities. Over the last fifteen years, substantive improvements have
been made due to the traction gained by the National Strategies for the
Development of Statistics (NSDSs), on which a large body of literature
is now available. PARIS21 maintains the NSDS guidelines,[2] which
provide statistical offices with a comprehensive and up-to-date set of
recommendations and good practices on data planning.

The key constraints that typically affect data planning are the
following:

-   Data demands change constantly. Users, including policy analysts,
    need faster, more granular, and reliable data. Supplying these
    ever-changing data is a challenge as statistical infrastructure and,
    in particular, data sources – whether administrative data or
    sample-survey-based – are often difficult to adjust under tight
    timeframes.

-   The number of data sources is burgeoning, and the pace of innovation
    is greater than ever.

-   More stakeholders are competing in a booming data market; therefore,
    the role of NSOs is undergoing considerable change.

-   Costing future activities is a challenge, as unit costs may be
    missing or evolving rapidly because of technological innovations.
    Budgeting remains a key issue in many countries, especially where
    data-related activities rely heavily on external funding, which is
    not always predictable.

-   Many different data plans (including the NSDS) exist in a given
    country’s data system and may conflict with one another.

and the NSDS

ADAPT supports several phases of the NSDS design and implementation
stages, including the *Assessing the NSS*, *Identifying strategic
goals*, *Elaborating action plans*, *Executing* and *Monitoring &
Reporting* phases. [Annex 5.4](#domestication-of-sdgs) further details
the specific steps under each phase, which can be facilitated through an
appropriate use of ADAPT.

ADAPT aims to make data planning agile to better reflect the realities
of country data ecosystems, which are characterised by ever-evolving
data demands and a constantly increasing number of stakeholders.
