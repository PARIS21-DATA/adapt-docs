## 4.2.1 Policies <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

Policies – whether global, national or sectoral development plans –
usually determine the nature and scope of the demand for data.
Therefore, in addition to being useful for the statistical planning
process of an NSS, ADAPT can also serve as a helpful tool in the policy
planning phase of the development process.

Figure 45 illustrates the first screen that appears when the *Policies*
menu is clicked on, indicating that three policies have been entered
into the system. The left side of the screen displays the options to
*Search* for a policy by title or *Filter* according to different
criteria: sector, date, logframe and geographic coverage. Clicking on
the arrowheads (to the left of the fields of each criterion) extends the
tree, as shown in the expanded grey portion immediately below. Note that
the list of policies is downloadable directly in CSV or Excel formats.

To add a new policy in ADAPT, simply click on the *+Add Policy* option.
The following screen appears (Figure 46). The red arrows depict the
sequence in which the information must be entered: first, the vertical
fields for each tab in the horizontal row should be filled out (arrow
1); then, in the next fields should be compiled, horizontally (arrow 2).

>
>Note that the input screen in Figure 46 above depicts a series of tabbed
entries. These tabs are horizontal and vertical. This general pattern of
tabbed entries is repeated for every menu item. In general, we recommend
that you first input information in the vertical entries and then move
across with horizontal entry, because vertical tabs are nested within
horizontal ones.

Now, simply fill out the required information corresponding to each
field, most of which is described in Table 3 below.

><a id="box5" class="box-title">Box 5 – Worth noting! The Completeness score</a>
>
><img src="ADAPTmedia\media\image57.png" />
>
>ADAPT provides users with a Completeness score (see top right-hand
corner of the entry screen). This provides guidance on how much of the
required information has been filled in and on the remaining fields to
be completed to achieve a higher score.
>
>You will find the Completeness score tab in every menu item of ADAPT.
Upon clicking on the tab, you may find a detailed Progress Report, which
shows exactly which fields are empty or complete, leading to the current
score. It is not necessary to fill every field to achieve a completeness
score of 100%.
>
>A Progress Report with a Completeness score of 100% is shown below for
reference:
>
><a id="figure47" class="figure-title">Figure 48: Progress Report for Completeness score</a>

><a id="box6" class="box-title">Box 6 – Worth noting!Entering geographic coverage</a>
>
>Geographic coverage refers to the area (country, region, province, etc.)
that is covered by a policy, logframe, indicator, data source, data plan
or organisation. It is a field that will pop up frequently when entering
information in the menu items.
>
>For ADAPT, the hierarchy of geographic coverage (or geographic levels)
is normally understood as the following: Global -&gt; Regional (for
example, a group of countries such as an intercontinental subgrouping or
an economic or political bloc) -&gt; National -&gt; Sub-National
(Province/State -&gt; District -&gt; Village, etc.). It is crucial to
note that if an item is applicable at a higher geographic level, it does
not necessarily also apply at a lower one.
>
>1. For organisations, policies, logframes and data plans:
>
>Any item applicable at a higher geographic level is also applicable at a
lower one. Therefore, ADAPT enables the automatic selection of all
“child” nodes under a parent node, if a parent node has been selected
for these.
>
>2. For indicators and data sources:
>
>Items applicable at a higher geographic level may or may not be
applicable at a lower one. Therefore, ADAPT does not automatically
select all “child” nodes under a parent node, if a parent node has been
selected. These must be manually selected by users on a case-by-case
basis.

><a id="box7" class="box-title">Box 7 – Worth noting! Mapping in ADAPT</a>
>
>Mapping is one of the most integral functions performed by ADAPT. It
appears in the *Policies*, *Indicators* and *Data Plans* menu items.
>
>Mapping is the action of linking different objects over a common element
in ADAPT.
>
>For policies, the object is Policy X and Policy Y, whereas the common
element over which the mapping is done is the sector.
>
><img src="_media\box7-1.png" class="figures" />
>
>For data plans, the objects are Data Plan X and Data Plan Y, whereas the
common element over which the mapping is done is the activity.
>
><img src="_media\box7-2.png" class="figures" />
>
>For indicators, the objects are Policy/Logframe X and Policy/Logframe X
(in case of repeating indicators, that is, reflection “within” demands)
or Policy/Logframe Y (in case of reflection “between demands”), whereas
the common element over which the mapping is done is the indicator
itself. Note that reflection is simply a special type of mapping:
specifically, mapping between the same elements.
>
><img src="_media\box7-3.png" class="figures" />
>
>In conclusion, in ADAPT, policies may be mapped based on common sectors;
common (or repeating) indicators can be mapped across different (or the
same) policies or logframes; and data plans can be mapped on the basis
of common activities.
