## 2.2 Multilingual access to ADAPT <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

ADAPT can be accessed in multiple languages. The sandbox creation
interface is available in Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian and
Spanish. When signing in to ADAPT, a “language-switcher” option is
located in the top right-hand corner. This can be used to toggle between
different languages.

When creating a sandbox instance, the language selected in the top
right-hand corner becomes the default language for the instance created.

The default interface for signing in will be in the preselected default
language (other than English, if selected while creating the instance)
or in English.

After signing in, you may add more options to the language-switcher
through *Site Administration* (*Translations* -&gt; *Language* -&gt;
*Languages*). These languages can be used to access the interface before
signing in. Changing the default language for the signing-in interface
is also possible through *Site Administration* (*Translations* -&gt;
*Language* -&gt; *Default language*). See [Section
3.2.1](#general-settings-customise) of this manual for further details.
