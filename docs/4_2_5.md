## 4.2.5 Data Plans <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

A data plan is a framework, process and product that has the purpose of
improving the production and the use of data and statistics. Data plans
may be designed at various geographic levels (global, regional, national
or subnational). They may be cross-cutting or sector-specific, and may
focus on one or several organisations.

Data plans include strategic plans at national level, such as the NSDS,
or at global level, such as the Cape Town Global Action Plan (CT-GAP).
Data plans also include operational plans. Examples include NSOs’ annual
programmes of work, the statistical programmes of work of governmental
organisations supporting the implementation of a sectoral policy, or the
investment plan in data of local development partners. In the context of
ADAPT, relevant data plans are those that focus primarily on data
systems generating public-policy-relevant data or statistics.

Figure 63 below shows the screen that appears when clicking on *Data
Plans*; from the example, it may be seen that three data plans have been
entered into the system. As before, the left side of the screen displays
the options to *Search* for an indicator or *Filter* according to
different criteria: *Implementation Status*, *Policy*, *Geographic
coverage* or *Sector*. Clicking on the arrowheads (to the left of each
criterion’s fields) extends the tree in the expanded grey portion as
before. Note that the list of data plans is downloadable directly in CSV
or Excel formats.

To add a new Data Plan in ADAPT, simply click on the <img src="ADAPTmedia\media\image92.png" /> button. A familiar screen pops up and the following set of horizontaland vertical tabs appears. The numbers next to the red arrows indicate the sequence in which you should fill in the information.

(Note that in the vertical tabs, the section *Monitoring Framework*
appears only when the user indicates the existence of a monitoring
framework for that data plan in the *Description* section)
