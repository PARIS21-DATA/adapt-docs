## 4.2.3 Indicators <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

The *Indicators* menu item is where demand-side and supply-side elements
meet. It contains a repository of all indicators demanded by a policy or
logframe (or even indicators without links to either) and corresponding
information on their availability. Here, the role of the mapping
functionality is of prime importance in showcasing any overlaps and gaps
in planning: a fundamental functionality of ADAPT itself.

Figure 53 illustrates the first screen that appears upon clicking on the
*Indicators* menu, showing that 258 indicators have been entered into
the system. As before, the left side of the screen displays options to
*Search* for an indicator or *Filter* according to logframe or policy.
Clicking on the arrowheads to the left of each criterion’s fields
extends the tree in the expanded grey portion, as before. Note that the
list of Logframes may be downloaded directly in CSV or Excel formats.

To add a new indicator in ADAPT, simply click on the <img src="ADAPTmedia\media\image73.png" /> option. The following screen appears (Figure 54); you must indicate whether the indicator is linked to a policy, a logframe or neither.

><a id="box10" class="box-title">Box 10 – Did you know? Bulk upload feature for indicators!</a>
>
>ADAPT allows for bulk uploading of indicators and related metadata via
Microsoft Excel. This feature is described in detail in [Section
5.4](5_4.md) of this manual.

Now, as shown in Figure 54 above, choose one of the options listed next
to *Link with primary*. If a link exists, you must choose the
corresponding policy or logframe from the drop-down list, which contains
options of logframes or policies entered in the preceding menu items.

><a id="box11" class="box-title">Box 11 – Did you know? Indicators with no links!</a>
>
>It is not necessary for indicators to be linked to a policy or logframe.
An example is the Global Strategy to improve Agricultural and Rural
Statistics (Global Strategy), prepared by the World Bank, UNSD and the
Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO). The
Global Strategy specifies a menu of indicators and a Minimum Set of Core
Data that are not linked to any global or national policies or
logframes.

Then, select the specific level and value to which the indicator is
attached (recall that the relevant indicator box in the logframe section
was checked when defining the nodes). An example is shown in Figure 55
below.

Next, a familiar screen appears, with the following set of horizontal
and vertical tabs. If there is no linkage with a policy or logframe,
then the *No link* option in the above figure is selected and these
horizontal and vertical tabs appear immediately.

The numbers next to the red arrows indicate the sequence in which the
information should be entered.
