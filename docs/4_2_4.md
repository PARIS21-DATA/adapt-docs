### 4.2.4 Data Sources

In general, a Data Source refers to a specific dataset, metadata set,
and database or metadata repository from which data or metadata are
available for various indicators. Therefore, the *Data Sources* menu
item is where the bulk of the supply-side information for an indicator
is stored, and logically comes after the *Indicators* menu item.

<span id="_Toc7208974" class="anchor"></span>Box 15 – In Practice! Enter
*Data Sources* before *Indicators*

Note that the information stored in the *Data Sources* menu is utilised
in the *Indicators* menu item (as available indicators are tied to *Data
Sources*). Therefore, it is recommended that in practice, users input
information into this menu first.

There are several types of data sources, depending on how the data is
gathered and on the population they are intended to represent. For
instance, Figure 61 below shows the first screen that appears when
clicking on *Data Sources*, detailing the sources that have been entered
into the system so far. As before, the left side of the screen displays
the options to *Search* for an indicator or *Filter* according to
different criteria: *Implementation Status*, *Category*, *Geographic
coverage* or *Sector*. Clicking on the arrowheads (to the left of each
criterion’s fields) extends the tree in the expanded grey portion, as
before. Note that the list of data sources is downloadable directly in
CSV and Excel formats.

Unlike the menu items explored previously in this manual, *Data Sources*
does not contain any horizontal tabs. After clicking on the *+ Add Data
Source* button, users are presented with the following options:

data source – *Implemented* or *On-going & Planned*?

<img src="ADAPTmedia\media\image88.png" style="width:6.04651in;height:1.19638in" />

ADAPT accounts for two types of data sources: *Implemented* and
*On-going & Planned*.

-   *Implemented*

<img src="ADAPTmedia\media\image89.png" style="width:1.0625in;height:1.41806in" />This
means that the data source has been carried out and the data have been
produced. When this option is selected, the following vertical tabs
appear:

-   *On-going & planned*

These are data sources for which data have not been produced yet and for
which operations are ongoing or planned. When this option is selected,
the following vertical tabs appear:

<img src="ADAPTmedia\media\image90.png" style="width:1.03125in;height:1.36111in" />

Note that only the last tab has changed, from *Data* *Access* to
*Funding status*. Table 6 below summarises the information required or
action undertaken in each vertical tab that appears when either
*Implemented* or *On-going & Planned* are selected.
