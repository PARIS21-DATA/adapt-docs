## 1.3 What is ADAPT and how does it help? <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

ADAPT is a free cloud-based data planning tool developed by PARIS21 to
address some of the challenges mentioned in the previous sections.

ADAPT is a consultative platform that brings together development
stakeholders in the promotion of policy-responsive data systems. It is
based on a demand-and-supply analysis of indicators, data sources,
capacities and skills, and links these assessments of gaps with the
priorities identified. ADAPT promotes the reuse of data and the quality
assessment of data sources. It helps monitor the implementation of data
plans, including the NSDS. ADAPT contributes to better data plans by
aligning their content to data needs. Additionally, it reinforces
co-ordinated data systems in national or regional contexts.

ADAPT uses relational database management system (RDBMS) technology and
is hosted in a secure cloud-based set-up. Within an NSS, multiple users
can use the tool simultaneously, therefore enabling iterative and
incremental data planning. It features multilingual support and can be
customised to specific countriesâ€™ needs. The current version is V1.1;
the present manual refers to this version.

***How does ADAPT help?***

Captures data demands

-   Catalogues data demanded by key global, regional and national
    policies

-   Maps these demands and shows potential for data reuse

-   Identifies policies and sectors that do not have Monitoring and
    Evaluation (M&E) frameworks

Identifies data gaps

-   Connects data demand to data supply

-   Checks compliance of available data

-   Identifies current data gaps

Identifies capacity or skills gaps

-   Provides a detailed capacity gaps assessment, by indicator

-   Provides an overview of skills missing throughout the organisation
    or NSS

-   Consistent with the GSBPM[3] and CD4.0[4] frameworks

Improves data planning

-   Maps the different global, regional, national, sectoral or
    subnational data strategies relevant to an organisation

-   Monitors implementation progress and institutional bottlenecks

-   Enables activity-based co-ordination

-   Allows detailed costing and budgeting of data planning activities

-   Identifies data priorities that are not addressed in current plans

ADAPT is embedded with several reporting and visualisation tools to
explain complex findings and facilitate understanding. Section [4.2.6
Reports](#reports) of this manual, titled Reports, details the reports
that can be generated by ADAPT and their possible uses.
