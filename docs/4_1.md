# **ADAPT Menus** <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

## 4.1 Overview of the ADAPT Menu items

The most important aspect of using and navigating ADAPT is understanding
the green Menu bar and the six items contained within it, which are
displayed below. Each menu item (except the last) serves as a storehouse
for distinct information and data to be entered by the user. The
*Reports* section displays ADAPT-generated reports based on the data fed
into the previous menu items. Before delving into a detailed description
of each section, see Table 2 for a brief overview of the ADAPT Menu
items.

| **Menu item**                                                                       | *What to expect: a bird’s-eye view*                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

| <img src="ADAPTmedia\media\image46.png" style="width:0.79097in;height:0.38194in" /> | Under the first menu item, users may enter basic details such as the name, geographic and sectoral coverage of a given development policy (such as the National Development Plan, or NDP), as well as information on institutional roles, linked logframes, mapping with other policies, etc. This forms the basis of the demand side of development planning in a country or region.                                                                                              |
| <img src="ADAPTmedia\media\image47.png" style="width:0.79097in;height:0.38194in" /> | Under this menu item, users can enter the details of a logframe – the M&E framework linked to a policy (described in the previous section), the various Organisations, etc. More importantly, this is where information on the various levels of the results chain framework are described for a logframe and can be viewed in a tabular form.                                                                                                                                     |
| <img src="ADAPTmedia\media\image48.png" style="width:0.78194in;height:0.39097in" /> | *Indicators* is the most data-intensive menu item in ADAPT. Indeed, it consists of both demand- and supply-side information on a given indicator; that is, the description of the indicator as outlined in a development policy (demand) and availability information from existing data sources that provide data for that particular indicator (supply). This is also the section where the level of compliance between the demand and supply sides of planning can be observed. |
| <img src="ADAPTmedia\media\image49.png" style="width:0.8in;height:0.37361in" />     | Under *Data Sources*, information on the implemented or planned data sources (for surveys, national accounts, other administrative data, etc.) can be stored, including basic details such as name, reference period, sectoral and geographic coverage, Organisations and availability of Data Documentation Initiative (DDI) files. The information on data sources fed here is also displayed in *Indicators*, under the relevant field.                                         |
| <img src="ADAPTmedia\media\image50.png" style="width:0.81736in;height:0.22569in" /> | As a corollary to *Policies*, this menu item is meant to contain information on data plans (such as an NSDS or a ministry’s programme of work), along with details on linked policies, organisational roles and the M&E framework, if applicable (as occurs for *Logframes* on the demand side). It also displays the mapping between different data plans at the activity level.                                                                                                  |
| <img src="ADAPTmedia\media\image51.png" style="width:0.70833in;height:0.26597in" /> | The final section, *Reports*, is where ADAPT does its share of the work based on all the information that the user has entered into the system under the first five menu items. ADAPT generates a set of Key Reports and a number of Advanced Reports based on the parameters or criteria selected by the user.                                                                                                                                                                    |
