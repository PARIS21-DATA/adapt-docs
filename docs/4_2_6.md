### 4.2.6 Reports

The *Reports* section is where all data entered in the previous five
menu items are tabulated and displayed in charts, to enable users to
extract better insights and gain an enhanced understanding of the given
data planning landscape. This is the only menu item in ADAPT for which
users do not need to input any information.

Figure 70 below shows the window that appears upon clicking on the
*Reports* menu item. The current version of ADAPT only contains Key
Reports. Advanced Reports will be made available in the next version.
Note that the reports are downloadable directly in PDF format by
clicking on the
